    "explanation": "Provides specific methods of serving summons on corporations, firms, or associations and recognizes registered post as valid service.\n\n## Section 66: Service when persons summoned cannot be found\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhere the person summoned cannot, by the exercise of due diligence, be found, the summons may be served by leaving one of the duplicates for him with some adult male member of his family residing with him; and the person with whom the summons is so left shall, if so required by the serving officer, sign a receipt therefor on the back of the other duplicate.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Allows alternate service of summons via family members if the summoned person cannot be located, and permits receipt endorsement.\n\n## Section 67: Procedure when service cannot be effected as before provided\n\n**Clause**:\n\nIf service in the manner mentioned in sections 64, 65 and 66 is not practicable, the serving officer shall affix one of the duplicates of the summons to some conspicuous part of the house or homestead in which the person summoned ordinarily resides, and thereupon the Court, after making such inquiries as it thinks fit, may either declare that the summons has been duly served or order fresh service in such manner as it considers proper.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Provides for affixation of summons when personal or familial service fails, followed by judicial validation or re-service order.\n\n## Section 68: Service on Government servant\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhere the person summoned is in the active service of the Government, the Court issuing the summons shall ordinarily send it in duplicate to the head of the office in which such person is employed and such head shall thereupon cause the summons to be served in the manner provided by section 64, and shall return it to the Court under his signature with the endorsement required by that section.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Summons to government employees must be routed through the head of office for service and acknowledgment.\n\n## Section 69: Service of summons outside local limits\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhen a Court desires that a summons issued by it shall be served at any place outside its local jurisdiction, it shall send the same in duplicate to a Magistrate within whose local jurisdiction the person summoned resides or is to be there served.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Mandates inter-jurisdictional cooperation for service of summons beyond the originating Court’s local authority.\n\n## Section 70: Proof of service in such cases and when serving officer not present\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhen a summons is served outside the local jurisdiction of the Court issuing it, and in any case where the serving officer is not present at the hearing of the case, an affidavit, purporting to be made before a Magistrate, that such summons has been served, and a duplicate of the summons purporting to be endorsed by the person to whom it was delivered or with whom it was left, shall be admissible in evidence, and the statements made therein shall be deemed to be correct unless and until the contrary is proved.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Validates service of summons via affidavit and endorsed duplicate in the absence of the serving officer at the hearing.\n\n## Section 71: Service of summons on witness\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding sections of this Chapter, a Court issuing a summons to a witness may, in addition to and simultaneously with the issue of such summons, direct a copy of the summons to be served by electronic communication or by registered post addressed to the witness at the place where he ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain.\n\n(2) When an acknowledgement purporting to be signed by the witness or an endorsement purporting to be made by a postal employee that the witness refused to take delivery of the summons has been received, or on the proof of delivery of summons under sub-section (3) of section 70 by electronic communication to the satisfaction of the Court, the Court issuing the summons may deem that the summons has been duly served.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Allows service of witness summons via electronic means or post; considers acknowledgment or refusal as valid proof of service.\n\n## Section 72: Form of warrant of arrest and duration\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) Every warrant of arrest issued by a Court under this Sanhita shall be in writing, signed by the presiding officer of such Court, and shall bear the seal of the Court.\n\n(2) Every such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the Court which issued it, or until it is executed.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Warrants must be formally written and sealed, remaining valid until execution or cancellation.\n\n## Section 73: Power to direct security to be taken\n\n**Clause**:\n\nAny Court issuing a warrant for the arrest of any person may, in its discretion, direct by endorsement on the warrant that, if such person executes a bond with sufficient sureties for his attendance before the Court at a specified time and thereafter until otherwise directed by the Court, the officer to whom the warrant is directed shall take such security and shall release such person from custody.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Enables endorsement of warrants with conditions for release on bond with sureties.\n\n## Section 74: Warrants to whom directed\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) A warrant of arrest shall ordinarily be directed to one or more police officers; but the Court issuing such a warrant may, if its immediate execution is necessary and no police officer is immediately available, direct it to any other person or persons, and such person or persons shall execute the same.\n\n(2) When a warrant is directed to more officers or persons than one, it may be executed by all, or by any one or more of them.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Allows warrants to be executed by multiple officers or designated non-police persons if needed urgently.\n\n## Section 75: Warrant may be directed to any person\n\n**Clause**:\n\nThe Court may, if immediate execution of a warrant is necessary and no police officer is immediately available, direct it to any person or persons and such person or persons shall execute the same.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Provides flexibility for urgent execution of warrants by individuals other than police officers if necessary.\n\n## Section 76: Warrant directed to a police officer\n\n**Clause**:\n\nA warrant directed to any police officer may also be executed by any other police officer whose name is endorsed upon the warrant by the officer to whom it is directed or endorsed.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Permits delegation of warrant execution among police officers by endorsement.\n\n## Section 77: Notification of substance of warrant\n\n**Clause**:\n\nThe police officer or other person executing a warrant of arrest shall notify the substance thereof to the person to be arrested, and, if so required, shall show him the warrant.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Requires informing the arrestee about the reason for arrest and showing the warrant upon request.\n\n## Section 78: Person arrested to be brought before Court without delay\n\n**Clause**:\n\nThe police officer or other person executing a warrant of arrest shall (subject to the provisions of section 83 as to security) without unnecessary delay bring the person arrested before the Court before which he is required by law to produce such person.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Ensures prompt presentation of the arrested individual before the appropriate Court.\n\n## Section 79: Where warrant may be executed\n\n**Clause**:\n\nA warrant of arrest may be executed at any place in India.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Establishes nationwide enforceability of arrest warrants.\n\n## Section 80: Warrant forwarded for execution outside jurisdiction\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhen a warrant is to be executed outside the local jurisdiction of the Court issuing the same, such Court may, instead of directing the warrant to a police officer, forward it by post or otherwise to any Executive Magistrate or District Superintendent of Police or Commissioner of Police within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it is to be executed, and the Magistrate or police officer to whom the warrant is so forwarded shall endorse his name thereon, and if practicable cause it to be executed in the manner hereinbefore provided.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Allows a court to forward a warrant outside its jurisdiction for execution by a local authority in that area.\n\n## Section 81: Warrant directed to police officer for execution outside jurisdiction\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhen a warrant directed to a police officer is to be executed beyond the local jurisdiction of the Court issuing the same, he shall ordinarily take it for endorsement either to an Executive Magistrate or to a District Superintendent of Police or to a Commissioner of Police within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the warrant is to be executed.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Directs police to obtain endorsement for execution of warrants outside local jurisdiction.\n\n## Section 82: Procedure on arrest of person against whom warrant issued\n\n**Clause**:\n\nThe police officer executing a warrant of arrest shall (subject to the provisions of section 83 as to security) without unnecessary delay bring the person arrested before the Court before which he is required by law to produce such person:\n\nProvided that such delay shall not in any case exceed twenty-four hours excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate’s Court.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Ensures arrested person is presented promptly before a magistrate, with time limits clearly defined.\n\n## Section 83: Procedure by Magistrate before whom such person arrested is brought\n\n**Clause**:\n\nThe Magistrate shall, if the person arrested appears to be the person intended by the Court which issued the warrant, direct his removal in custody to such Court:\n\nProvided that, if the offence is bailable, and such person is ready and willing to give bail to the satisfaction of such Magistrate, the Magistrate shall take such bail and forward the bond to the Court which issued the warrant.\n\nProvided further that if the offence is non-bailable, it shall be lawful for the Chief Judicial Magistrate or the Sessions Judge of the district in which the arrest is made to release such person on bail, subject to section 480.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Guides how a Magistrate must handle bail and custody decisions post-arrest.\n\n## Section 84: Proclamation for person absconding\n\n**Clause**:\n\nIf any Court has reason to believe that any person against whom a warrant has been issued has absconded or is concealing himself so that such warrant cannot be executed, such Court may publish a written proclamation requiring him to appear at a specified place and at a specified time not less than thirty days from the date of publishing such proclamation.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Empowers courts to publicly summon individuals evading warrants.\n\n## Section 85: Attachment of property of person absconding\n\n**Clause**:\n\nThe Court issuing a proclamation under section 84 may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, at any time after the issue of the proclamation order the attachment of any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to the proclaimed person:\n\nProvided that where at the time of the issue of the proclamation the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the person in relation to whom the proclamation is to be issued is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property or is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local jurisdiction of the Court, it may order the attachment simultaneously with the issue of the proclamation.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Grants courts the power to seize the property of absconding individuals, even pre-emptively.\n\n## Section 86: Identification and attachment of property of proclaimed person\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) The Court shall, after issuing a proclamation under section 84 and after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, issue a warrant for the attachment of any property belonging to the proclaimed person.\n\n(2) Such warrant shall authorise the attachment of any property, movable or immovable, or both, wherever it may be found in India.\n\n(3) The provisions of the Code relating to attachment of property shall apply to such attachment.\n\n**Explanation**: Empowers the court to identify and attach the property of proclaimed offenders across India after proper inquiry and issuance of a proclamation.\n\n## Section 87: Claims and objections to attachment\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) If any claim is preferred to, or objection is made to the attachment of, any property attached under section 85 or section 86, within six months from the date of such attachment, by any person other than the proclaimed person, the claim or objection shall be inquired into and determined by the Court by which the attachment was ordered, unless it considers that the claim or objection was designedly or unnecessarily delayed.\n\n(2) The Court may postpone the sale of the property pending such inquiry.\n\n**Explanation**: Provides a six-month window for third-party claims or objections to attached property, with the court retaining discretion over delay and sale postponement.\n\n## Section 88: Release, sale and restoration of attached property\n\n**Clause**:\n\nIf the proclaimed person appears within the time specified in the proclamation, the Court shall make an order releasing the property from the attachment. If such person does not appear within the time specified, the property shall be at the disposal of the Government and may be sold or otherwise disposed of as directed by the Court.\n\nThe Court may also make an order restoring the property or the proceeds thereof to the rightful claimant after hearing the claim under section 87.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Stipulates conditions for release or disposal of attached property based on the appearance or non-appearance of the proclaimed individual.\n\n## Section 89: Appeal from order rejecting application for restoration of attached property\n\n**Clause**:\n\nAny person aggrieved by an order under section 88 rejecting the application for restoration of attached property may appeal to the Court of Session within thirty days from the date of such order.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Grants right of appeal to the Sessions Court against rejection of claims for restoration of property.\n\n## Section 90: Issue of warrant in lieu of, or in addition to, summons\n\n**Clause**:\n\nA Court may, in any case in which it is empowered by this Sanhita to issue a summons for the appearance of any person, issue, after recording reasons in writing, a warrant for his arrest—\n\n- (a) if, either before the issue of such summons or after the issue of the same but before the time fixed for his appearance, the Court sees reason to believe that he has absconded or will not obey the summons; or\n\n- (b) if, at such time he fails to appear and the summons is proved to have been duly served in time to permit of his appearing and no reasonable excuse is offered for such failure.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Permits issuance of a warrant if a summoned person is suspected of evasion or fails to appear without reasonable cause.\n\n## Section 91: Power to take bond or bail bond for appearance\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhen any person for whose appearance or arrest the officer presiding in any Court is empowered to issue a summons or warrant is present in such Court, such officer may require such person to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for his appearance in such Court.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Authorizes courts to take a bond for future appearance from a person already present, avoiding the need for further summons or warrant.\n\n## Section 92: Arrest on breach of bond or bail bond for appearance\n\n**Clause**:\n\nIf the Court sees reason to believe that a person who has executed a bond under section 91 is likely to abscond or fail to appear as required, it may issue a warrant for his arrest.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Grants courts authority to arrest bonded individuals who pose a flight risk or may fail to appear.\n\n## Section 93: Provisions of this Chapter generally applicable to summonses and warrants\n\n**Clause**:\n\nThe provisions contained in this Chapter relating to summonses and warrants, and their issue, service and execution, shall, so far as may be, apply to all summonses and warrants issued under this Sanhita.\n\n\n**Explanation**: Establishes that the procedures in Chapter VI apply universally to all summonses and warrants issued under BNSS.\n\n## Chapter VII: Processes to Compel the Production of Things (Sections 94-110)\n\n**Description**: This chapter outlines the legal procedures for compelling the production of documents or other things, including the issuance of summons to produce, search-warrants, and general provisions relating to searches, as well as miscellaneous provisions for handling such processes.",

(2) The Court or the Magistrate shall cause a statement to be prepared under the supervision of a police officer not below the rank of a sub-inspector recording the details of the property.     (3) The statement prepared under sub-section (2) shall be supported by photographs or videography of the property taken under the supervision of such police officer and such police officer and the person who has taken such photographs or videography shall certify under his signature that the photographs or videography truly represent the property.     (4) The statement prepared under sub-section (2) and the photograph or the videography taken under sub-section (3) shall be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Sanhita.     (5) The Court or the Magistrate shall, within a period of thirty days after the statement has been prepared under sub-section (2) and the photograph or the videography has been taken under sub-section (3), order the disposal, destruction, confiscation or delivery of the property in the manner specified hereinafter.\n\n## Section 498: Order for disposal of property at conclusion of trial\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) When an inquiry or trial in any Criminal Court is concluded, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal, by destruction, confiscation or delivery to any person claiming to be entitled to possession thereof or otherwise, of any property or document produced before it or in its custody, or regarding which any offence appears to have been committed, or which has been used for the commission of any offence.\n\n(2) An order may be made under sub-section (1) for the delivery of any property to any person claiming to be entitled to the possession thereof, without any condition or on condition that he executes a bond, with or without sureties, to the satisfaction of the Court, engaging to restore such property to the Court if the order made under sub-section (1) is modified or set aside on appeal or revision.\n\n(3) A Court of Session may, instead of itself making an order under sub-section (1), direct the property to be delivered to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who shall thereupon deal with it in the manner provided in sections 499, 500 and 501.\n\n(4) Except where the property is livestock or is subject to speedy and natural decay, or where a bond has been executed in pursuance of sub-section (2), an order made under sub-section (1) shall not be carried out for two months, or when an appeal is presented, until such appeal has been disposed of.\n\n(5) In this section, the term “property” includes, in the case of property regarding which an offence appears to have been committed, not only such property as has been originally in the possession or under the control of any party, but also any property into or for which the same may have been converted or exchanged, and anything acquired by such conversion or exchange, whether immediately or otherwise.\n\n\n## Section 499: Payment to innocent purchaser of money found on accused\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhen any person is convicted of any offence which includes, or amounts to, theft or receiving stolen property, and it is proved that any other person bought the stolen property from him in good faith, the Court may, on the application of such purchaser and on the restitution of the stolen property to the person entitled to the possession thereof, order that out of any money found in the possession of the offender at the time of his apprehension, a sum not exceeding the price paid by such purchaser be paid to him.\n\n\n## Section 500: Order to pay compensation to person affected by offence\n\n**Clause**:\n\nWhen any person is convicted of any offence by use of criminal force or show of force or by criminal intimidation, and it appears to the Court that any person has suffered loss or injury by reason of such offence, the Court may, when passing judgment, order the person convicted to pay, by way of compensation, such amount as it may determine to the person who has suffered such loss or injury.\n\n\n## Section 501: Destruction of libellous and other matter\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) On a conviction under section 294, section 295, or sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 356 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, the Court may order the destruction of all the copies of the thing in respect of which the conviction was had, and which are in the custody of the Court or remain in the possession or power of the person convicted.\n\n(2) On a conviction under section 274, section 275, section 276 or section 277 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, the Court may order the food, drink, drug or medical preparation in respect of which the conviction was had, to be destroyed.\n\n\n## Section 502: Power to restore possession of immovable property\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) When a person is convicted of an offence by use of criminal force or show of force or by criminal intimidation, and it appears to the Court that, by such use of force or show of force or intimidation, any person has been dispossessed of any immovable property, the Court may, if it thinks fit, order that possession of the same be restored to that person after evicting by force, if necessary, any other person who may be in possession of the property:\n\n**Provided** that no such order shall be made by the Court more than one month after the date of the conviction.\n\n(2) Where the Court trying the offence has not made an order under sub-section (1), the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision may, if it thinks fit, make such order while disposing of the appeal, reference or revision, as the case may be.\n\n(3) Where an order has been made under sub-section (1), the provisions of section 500 shall apply in relation thereto as they apply in relation to an order under section 499.\n\n\n## Section 503: Procedure by police upon seizure of property\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) Whenever the seizure of property by any police officer is reported to a Magistrate under the provisions of this Sanhita, and such property is not produced before a Criminal Court during an inquiry or trial, the Magistrate may make such order as he thinks fit respecting the disposal of such property or the delivery of such property to the person entitled to the possession thereof, or if such person cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of such property.\n\n(2) If the person so entitled is known, the Magistrate may order the property to be delivered to him on such conditions (if any) as the Magistrate thinks fit and if such person is unknown, the Magistrate may detain it and shall, in such a case, issue a proclamation specifying the articles of which such property consists, and requiring any person who may have a claim thereto, to appear before him and establish his claim within six months from the date of such proclamation.\n\n\n## Section 504: Procedure where no claimant appears within six months\n\n**Clause**:\n\n(1) If no person within such period establishes his claim to such property, and if the person in whose possession such property was found is unable to show that it was legally acquired by him, the Magistrate may by order direct that such property shall be at the disposal of the State Government and may be sold by that Government and the proceeds of such sale shall be dealt with in such manner as may be prescribed.\n\n(2) An appeal shall lie against any such order to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from convictions by the Magistrate.\n\n\n## Section 505: Power to sell perishable property\n\n**Clause**:\n\nIf the person entitled to the possession of such property is unknown or absent and the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, or if the Magistrate to whom its seizure is reported is of opinion that its sale would be for the benefit of the owner, or that the value of such property is less than ten thousand rupees, the Magistrate may at any time direct it to be sold; and the provisions of sections 503 and 504 shall, as nearly as may be practicable, apply to the net proceeds of such sale.\n\n\n## Chapter XXXVII: Irregular Proceedings (Sections 506-512)\n\n**Description**: This chapter addresses irregularities in judicial and magisterial proceedings that may or may not invalidate outcomes. It specifies actions by magistrates not empowered by law that do not vitiate proceedings if done in good faith, those that render proceedings void, and general provisions for handling errors, omissions, or irregularities to prevent miscarriage of justice.",
